Semantic segmentation of water bodies on satellite imagery
About
A brand new dataset containing labeled images was prepared specifically for this project. The labeling process was semi-automated, assisted by OpenCV. Semantic segmentation is a common application of convolutional neural networks. However, the project implementation was mirrored in both PyTorch and TensorFlow, enabling a practical comparison between these two widely used deep learning frameworks.
