Experience
Doctoral student
AGH University of Krakow	Oct 2019 – Present
(4 yrs)
Using Deep Learning and drones for estimation of river water level. An unconventional regression approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks. Featured at prestigious AI conference NeurIPS 2021.
Calibration of drone thermal images using gradient descent. A custom application of the PyTorch library, in which instead of one large model, many small models were optimized simultaneously to align values of a large number of overlapping aerial images.
Time series forecasting of groundwater levels. An approach that integrates autoregression with the incorporation of exogenous satellite data for predicting groundwater levels using Ridge regression.
Semantic segmentation of rivers on satellite imagery. Classical pixel classification task using CNNs. A brand new dataset has been prepared specifically for this project. Developed in two versions using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
Geospatial segmentation based on user prompt. GUI tool for semi-supervised aerial image clustering based on small amount of user prompted data.
High performance cloud computing on cluster computer.
Communicating analytical results experience gained through participation in three international conferences and writing two English-language scientific articles.
Interpersonal skills proven as a deputy chairman of the departmental doctoral student government, university teacher and member of an international research group.
